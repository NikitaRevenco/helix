description: Learn how to configure language servers and auto formatting in Helix
---

Language Servers provide functionality such as:

- Goto definition
- Hover
- Goto references
- Search symbol in workspace
- Diagnostics

Language Servers support is a priority for Helix, and we provide out of the box configurations for basically every language you would want.

In this guide we'll explore how to setup language server for Go, as well as formatting on save. The process will be similar for other languages.

First, let's check what we need to add Go support. Use `hx --health <language>` to check the status. For instance:

```sh
hx --health go
```

```ansi
Configured language servers:
 [31mâœ˜[0m gopls: [31m'gopls' not found in $PATH[0m
 [31mâœ˜[0m jedi-language-server: [31m'golangci-lint-langserver' not found in $PATH[0m
Configured debug adapter: [32mdlv[0m
Binary for debug adapter: [31m'dlv' not found in $PATH[0m
Configured formatter: [33mNone[0m
Highlight queries: [32mâœ“[0m
Textobject queries: [32mâœ“[0m
Indent queries: [32mâœ“[0m
```

## Language Server

Helix tells us that `gopls` is already configured, even though we haven't installed it. Install it using your operating system's package manager!

---

Now that you've installed it, check `hx --health` again:

```ansi
Configured language servers:
 [32mâœ“[0m gopls: [32m/path/to/gopls[0m
 [31mâœ˜[0m jedi-language-server: [31m'golangci-lint-langserver' not found in $PATH[0m
Configured debug adapter: [32mdlv[0m
Binary for debug adapter: [31m'dlv' not found in $PATH[0m
Configured formatter: [33mNone[0m
Highlight queries: [32mâœ“[0m
Textobject queries: [32mâœ“[0m
Indent queries: [32mâœ“[0m
```

Perfect, now the language server will be configured for you.

## Formatter

Now we want to configure formatting on save for Go. There are many different formatters, and we'll go with [`gofumpt`](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt).

Go ahead and install `gofumpt` with your package manager...

---

Now that it's installed, we'll configure `gopls` to use `gofumpt`.

If you haven't already, create a `languages.toml` file in your helix config directory, which will vary by operating system:

- Linux and Mac: `~/.config/helix/languages.toml`
- Windows: `%AppData%\helix\languages.toml`

Then add the following to the file:

```toml
# languages.toml
[language-server.gopls.config]
gofumpt = true
```

Now go into your Go file and check, formatting and LSP will both work!

## Next steps

- Table of all languages and whether there is a default LSP for them: [language support](/help/language-defaults).
- List of [language server configurations per language](/reference/language-servers).
- List of [formatter configurations per language](/reference/formatters).

## Can't find what you're looking for?

:::tip

If you want to install a language server / formatter which Helix doesn't configure, you've looked at [formatters reference](/reference/formatters) and [language servers reference](/configuration/languages) but found nothing that helps you, a decent next step is to use GitHub's search feature.

In all likelyhood, _someone_ has probably created the same setup that you want to have in Helix. A [quick search](https://github.com/search?q=path%3Ahelix%2Flanguages.toml&type=code) on GitHub with the query of `path:helix/languages.toml` yields thousands of results.

If you want to install a formatter like `<whatever>` and feel like you're stuck, then we recommend searching for e.g. `path:helix/languages.toml <whatever>` and looking at the results to find out if any of the code samples you find will help you. In all likelihood, you'll succeed!

Once you figure it out, [please send us a pull request](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/compare) to add it to the docs!
