import { T } from "@/termshots/multiple-cursors/index.astro"

One of the most powerful features Helix has is multiple cursor support in combination with macros.

It allows you to perform complex refactors which can be broken down to a series of steps, as well as search-and-replace.

The best way to learn is with examples, and we'll provide you with many examples in this page.

## Multiple Cursors

We have some HTML which has repeating classes:

<T.HtmlBeginningState />

And we want to change each `px-3` class to `px-4`, aswell as each `font-bold` class to `font-thin`:

<T.HtmlFinalState />

### Using multiple cursors

1. Place your cursor on the first `3`:

   <T.CursorOnFirst3 />

1. Press <kbd>C</kbd> which creates a cursor below, until you have a cursor on each individual `3`:

   <T.CursorOnEach3 />

1. Press `r` which will replace the character, and then `4` to replace each of the `3`s with a `4`.

   <T.Each3ReplacedWith4 />

1. Our goal is to change the class `font-bold` to `font-thin`, which you can do by pressing <kbd>bbb</kbd> until each `bold` is highlighted:

   <T.EachBoldIsHighlighted />

1. Press <kbd>c</kbd> to change, and then type `thin` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to return back to normal mode.

   <T.EachBoldChangedToThin />

Let's see another way to do the same thing.

### Same example, different strategy

1. From the following state:

   <T.HtmlBeginningState />

1. Press <kbd>gw</kbd> to show two letters at the start of each word:

   <T.UsedGotoWord />

1. Navigate to the first instance of the `bold` word by pressing the 2-character key combination, which in our case that would be <kbd>ac</kbd>:

   <T.SelectedFirstBoldWithGw />

1. The entire `bold` word is highlighted now.

   Press <kbd>C</kbd> again 3 times until you select each instance of `bold`:

   <T.EachBoldIsHighlightedAgain />

1. As you see, the visual selection gets transferred over!

   Change the contents of each selection by using <kbd>c</kbd> to delete and enter insert mode -- then type `thin` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to return back to normal mode.

   <T.EachBoldChangedToThinAgain />

1. Press <kbd>f</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> to find the next 3:

   <T.EntirePxClassHighlighted />

1. We could delete the entire `px-3` class if we wanted.

   Instead press <kbd>a</kbd> to append at the end of each selection, which puts us into insert mode.

   <T.InsertModeAfterEachPxClass />

1. Delete the 3 by pressing backspace, then add a 4, exiting back to insert mode with <kbd>Esc</kbd>:

   <T.FinalTransformationAgain />

These two examples show that often there are multiple ways to accomplish the same refactoring in Helix. Over time, you'll be able to choose which way to use based on the circumstances.

## Macros

Macros are a way to record your keystrokes and then replay them whenever you want to.

Basic keymaps:

- <kbd>Q</kbd> will begin recording a macro into the [register](/getting-started/basics#registers) `Q`.
- <kbd>q</kbd> replays the macro from register `Q`.

You can have a lot of macros at your disposal in various registers, ready to use whenever. You use registers with macros just like usual.

For example, to record a macro into a specific register, press <kbd>"</kbd> to select the register, then a character which will be the register where your macro is stored, and then <kbd>Q</kbd>. For instance:

- <kbd>"</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> to record a macro into the `e` register.

To stop recording, press `Q` again.

Replay the macro by using register + <kbd>q</kbd>. For example:

- <kbd>"</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>

### Using macros

1. Place your cursor on the first line, after the dash:

   <T.CursorAfterDash />

1. Use <kbd>Q</kbd> to begin recording a macro, and press <kbd>e</kbd> to select the full `thin` word:

   <T.RecordingMacroBegins />

1. Change it to `bold` using <kbd>c</kbd> to delete and insert mode, then type `bold` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go back to normal mode:

   <T.ChangedThinToBoldMacro />

1. Use <kbd>f</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> to find to next 3, and then <kbd>;</kbd> to collapse selection to a single cursor in order to select the `3`:

   <T.SelectedFirst3 />

1. Replace it with a `4` using <kbd>r</kbd> to enter replace mode which waits for the next character, and type `4`:

   <T.Replaced3With4 />

1. Press <kbd>Q</kbd> to stop recording the macro.

   <T.FinishedRecordingMacro />

1. Okay, so the hard part is done!

   Now go back to the `-` you started from by using <kbd>F</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> which finds the previous `-`.

   Repeat this motion by using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> and then collapse selection with <kbd>;</kbd>:

   <T.BackToTheBeginning />

1. Hit <kbd>j</kbd> to go down a line and create 2 more cursors on each `-` by pressing <kbd>C</kbd> 2 more times:

   <T.Created3MoreCursors />

1. And just press <kbd>q</kbd> (note the lowercase q) to repeat the motions you've recorded earlier.

   <T.FinalStateWithMacros />

## Search and Select

We've just explored the very basics of how to use multiple cursors and macros, but in fact they're a lot more powerful than seems at first glance.

Let's consider the following file, which includes some repetition:

<T.PythonBeginningState />

And we want every variable to be a maximum of 3 characters, as well as the functions have to be static methods on a class. The final outcome will look like this:

<T.PythonFinalState />

### Search and Replace

1. First, let's rename each of the functions from `calculate_whatever` to `get_whatever`.

   The easiest way to do search-and-replace in Helix is to first select the entire file with <kbd>%</kbd>.

   <T.SelectedFullPythonFile />

1. We're going to use <kbd>s</kbd> which allows us to _**s**elect_ inside of our selection.

   Basically, it takes an input and will search for that input and create a cursor everywhere it finds it.

   <T.UsedSToSelectInsideSelection />

1. Type the following: `calculate` and then <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   <T.TypedCalculate />

   As you see, it created a selection and a cursor on every single instance of the `calculate` word.

   We can now just press <kbd>c</kbd> to delete the contents of each selection, which also places us into insert mode, and type `get` then <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go back to normal more:

   <T.ReplacedEachCalculateWithGet />

1. Now that we have a cursor on each function definition, lets create an empty line above each cursor by pressing <kbd>O</kbd> and then writing `@staticmethod`, finally going back to normal mode with <kbd>Esc</kbd>:

   <T.AddedStaticMethodIndicator />

1. Our goal is to rename the parameters to be 3 letters.

   To do this, we're going to first select the function definition as well as the first line of the body of each function, with <kbd>j</kbd> and then by using <kbd>x</kbd> twice:

   <T.SelectedFirstTwoLinesOfEachFunction />

1. Let's use <kbd>s</kbd> now which will ask us for a prompt.

   This time, we won't just enter a string but we'll enter a very small regex: `\w+`, which selects every word:

   <T.SelectedEveryWord />

1. This selected a few extra words than we wanted, but that's okay! One of the selections is the "primary" selection which we can tell by the `2:3` in the left right corner, which means that our primary selection is on line 2 character 3.

   We can make the next selection our primary selection by using <kbd>)</kbd>, which is seen by the `2:12` in the counter, meaning that our primary selection is at the `get_area` method:

   <T.NextSelectionPrimary />

   We can go back to the previous one with <kbd>(</kbd>:

   <T.BackToPreviousSelection />

1. By pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>, we can remove the primary selection, so that `def` is not selected:

   <T.RemovedPrimarySelection />

1. Removing that selection automatically made `get_area` the next selected region. We don't want this one either, so we'll remove it again with <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>:

   <T.RemovedPrimarySelectionAgain />

   Press <kbd>)</kbd> a few times until you reach the next selection you want to remove. If you go over by one, just press <kbd>(</kbd> to make the previous selection primary.

1. Let's repeat the previous step until we _only_ have the words `length`, `width` and `height` selected:

   <T.OnlyParamsSelected />

1. At this point, we can begin our removal process.

   Go to the beginning of each word by pressing <kbd>b</kbd>, and then press <kbd>l</kbd> a couple of times until you are on the 4th character of each word:

   <T.OnFourthCharOfEachWord />

1. Let's press <kbd>e</kbd> to go to the end of each word which will highlight it:

   <T.SelectEndOfEachParam />

1. Press <kbd>d</kbd> to delete it.

   <T.DeletedEndOfEachWord />

1. Great we're almost there!

   Let's actually undo this step so that we can look at an alternative way of accomplishing the same result.

   Press `u` just once which will undo our replacement:

   <T.UndidStep />

1. An alternative way is to select the entire file again with <kbd>%</kbd>:

   <T.SelectedEntireFileAgain />

1. With the power of <kbd>s</kbd> and Regex, we can select the `length`, `width` and `height` words by chaining them together with the "OR" operator.

   For instance, type the following: `length|width|height`:

   <T.SelectedAllLengthWidthHeight />

   This is certaintly simpler but it's good to know both approaches.

1. Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select and go to the beginning of each word with <kbd>b</kbd>

1. Move 3 characters to the right with <kbd>lll</kbd>
1. Press <kbd>e</kbd> to go to the end of each word and delete it:

   <T.RemovedLastPartOfEachParam />

1. Lets to remove the variable declarations of `result` on each line, and instead directly return the calculation.

   Go ahead and select the entire file again with <kbd>%</kbd> then use the <kbd>s</kbd> to bring up the select prompt again.

1. Type `result =` which will select all instances of `result =`:

   <T.SelectedAllResultVars />

1. <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select, and then Press <kbd>C</kbd> to duplicate the selection on each line:

   <T.SelectedAllResultVarsAndC />

1. By using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>(</kbd>, we can rotate the _contents_ of the selection backward:

   <T.RotatedContentsOfSelections />

   Try using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>)</kbd> to rotate the selection forward. You can keep on pressing the key but the difference between <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>)</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>(</kbd> won't be obvious in this example, since we basically have the same selections repeated.

   Regardless, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>)</kbd> at least once to get into the following state:

   <T.RotatedContentsOfSelections />

1. Collapse each cursor so that there is only a single selection with <kbd>;</kbd>:

   <T.EachSelectionCollapsed />

1. Now, just press <kbd>d</kbd> twice to delete two characters on each of the 6 lines:

   <T.DeletedTwoChars />

1. Okay so at this point, we are _almost_ there. We just need to delete the `result sult` line.

   To do this, use the <kbd>s</kbd> again and type `s` in the prompt. This will select the `s` in each of your selections and place a cursor there:

   <T.SelectedAllS />

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select, and then press <kbd>x</kbd> to select the entire line and <kbd>d</kbd> to delete it. Voila!

   <T.Deleted3Lines />

1. We've got just a few steps left. Namely, select the entire file again with <kbd>%</kbd>:

   <T.SelectedEntireFileAgain2 />

1. Press <kbd>\></kbd> which will indent everything by 1 level. We need this since we're going to nest it in a class, after all. You can also use <kbd>\<</kbd> to de-dent the selection by 1 level too.

   <T.IndentAllBy1Level />

1. Press <kbd>i</kbd> to go into insert mode at the very beginning of the selection, <kbd>Enter</kbd> to add a newline.

Use <kbd>Esc</kbd> to enter normal mode and then <kbd>k</kbd> to go to the line above, <kbd>I</kbd> to enter Insert mode.

1. Finally, type `class Calculator:` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go back to normal mode.

   <T.FinalStatePython />

At last, we've succeeded 🥳!
