title: Multiple Cursors

import { T } from "@/termshots/multiple-cursors/index.astro"

One of the most powerful features Helix has is multiple cursor support in combination with macros.

It allows you to perform complex refactors which can be broken down to a series of steps, as well as seacrh-and-replace.

The best way to learn is with examples, and we'll provide you with many examples in this page.

## Introduction

We have some HTML which has repeating classes, and we want to refactor it. From this:

<T.HtmlBeginningState />

To this:

<T.HtmlFinalState />

### Basic Example

First, place your cursor on the first `3`:

<T.CursorOnFirst3 />

Next, press <kbd>C</kbd> which creates a cursor below, until you have a cursor on each individual `3`:

<T.CursorOnEach3 />

Now, just press `r` which will replace the character, and then `4` to replace each of the `3`s with a `4`.

<T.Each3ReplacedWith4 />

Our goal is to change the class `font-bold` to `font-thin`, which you can do by pressing <kbd>bbb</kbd> until each `bold` is highlighted:

<T.EachBoldIsHighlighted />

Press <kbd>c</kbd> to change, and then type `thin ` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to return back to normal mode.

<T.EachBoldChangedToThin />

Success! Let's see another way to do the same thing.

### Another Example

From the following state:

<T.HtmlBeginningState />

Press <kbd>gw</kbd> to show two letters at the start of each word:

<T.UsedGotoWord />

Navigate to the first instance of the `bold` word by pressing the 2-character key combination, which in our case that would be <kbd>ac</kbd>:

<T.SelectedFirstBoldWithGw />

The entire `bold` word is highlighted now. Press <kbd>C</kbd> again 3 times until you select each instance of `bold`:

<T.EachBoldIsHighlightedAgain />

As you see, the visual selection gets transferred over! Again, change the contents of each selection by using <kbd>c</kbd> to delete and enter insert mode -- then type `thin` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to return back to normal mode.

<T.EachBoldChangedToThinAgain />

Press <kbd>f</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> to find the next 3:

<T.EntirePxClassHighlighted />

We could delete the entire `px-3` class if we wanted, but instead we'll press <kbd>a</kbd> to append at the end of each selection, which puts us into insert mode.

<T.InsertModeAfterEachPxClass />

Delete the 3 by pressing backspace, then add a 4, exiting back to insert mode with <kbd>Esc</kbd>:

<T.FinalTransformationAgain />

### With macros

Macros also allow you to repeat certain motions, and they can be used in combination with multiple cursor!

Place your cursor on the first line, after the dash:

<T.CursorAfterDash />

Use <kbd>Q</kbd> to begin recording a macro, and then press <kbd>e</kbd> to select the full `thin` word:

<T.RecordingMacroBegins />

Change it to `bold` using <kbd>c</kbd> to delete and insert mode, then type `bold` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go back to normal mode:

<T.ChangedThinToBoldMacro />

Now <kbd>f</kbd> (find) + <kbd>3</kbd> (find to next 3) + <kbd>;</kbd> (collapse selection to a single cursor) to select the `3`:

<T.SelectedFirst3 />

And replace it with a `4` using <kbd>r</kbd> to enter replace mode which waits for the next character, and type `4`:

<T.Replaced3With4 />

Press <kbd>Q</kbd> to stop recording the macro.

<T.FinishedRecordingMacro />

Okay, so the hard part is done! Now go back to the `-` you started from by using <kbd>F</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> which finds the previous `-`, repeat this motion by using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> and then collapse selection with <kbd>;</kbd>:

<T.BackToTheBeginning />

Hit <kbd>j</kbd> to go down a line and create 2 more cursors on each `-` by pressing <kbd>C</kbd> 2 more times:

<T.Created3MoreCursors />

And just press <kbd>q</kbd> (note the lowercase q) to repeat the motions you've recorded earlier.

<T.FinalStateWithMacros />

## Macros

Macros are a way to record your keystrokes and then replay them whenever you want to. By default, when you press <kbd>Q</kbd> a macro will begin recording into the register `Q`.

When you press <kbd>q</kbd>, it will replay the macro from register `Q`. But you can have a lot of macros at your disposal, ready to use whenever.

For example, to record a macro into a specific register, press <kbd>"</kbd> to select the register, then a character which will be the register where your macro is stored, and then <kbd>Q</kbd>. So for example:

- <kbd>"</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> to record a macro into the `e` register.

To stop recording, just pressing `Q` again is enough.

Replay the macro by using register + <kbd>q</kbd>. So continuing our previous example:

- <kbd>"</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>

## Search and Select

We've just explored the very basics of how to use multiple cursors and macros, but in fact they're a lot more powerful than seems at first glance.

Let's consider the following file, which includes some repetition:

<T.PythonBeginningState />

And we want every variable to be a maximum of 3 characters, as well as the functions have to be static methods on a class.

<T.PythonFinalState />

### Search and Replace

First, let's rename each of the functions from `calculate_whatever` to `get_whatever`. The easiest way to do search-and-replace in Helix is to first select the entire file with <kbd>%</kbd>.

<T.SelectedFullPythonFile />

Next, we're going to use <kbd>s</kbd> which allows us to _**s**elect_ inside of our selection. Basically, it takes an input and will search for that input and create a cursor everywhere it finds it.

<T.UsedSToSelectInsideSelection />

Type the following: `calculate` and then <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

<T.TypedCalculate />

As you see, it created a selection and a cursor on every single instance of the `calculate` word.

Awesome, we can now just press <kbd>c</kbd> to delete the contents of each selection, which also places us into insert mode, and then type `get` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go back to normal more:

<T.ReplacedEachCalculateWithGet />

Now we have a cursor on each function definition, this is perfect and we shouldn't lose this opportunity (e.g. by instinctively using <kbd>,</kbd> to collapse each cursor into a single one)

Instead, we're going to create an empty line above each cursor by pressing <kbd>O</kbd> and then writing `@staticmethod`, finally going back to normal mode with <kbd>Esc</kbd>:

<T.AddedStaticMethodIndicator />

Now our goal is to rename the parameters to be 3 letters instead. To do this, we're going to first select the function definition as well as the first line of the body of each function, with <kbd>j</kbd> and then by using <kbd>x</kbd> twice:

<T.SelectedFirstTwoLinesOfEachFunction />

Let's use <kbd>s</kbd> now which will ask us for a prompt. This time, we won't just enter a string but we'll enter a very small regex: `\w+`. This is going to select every word:

<T.SelectedEveryWord />

This selected a few extra words than we wanted, but that's okay! One of the selections is the "primary" selection which we can tell by the `2:3` in the bottom right corner, which means that our primary selection is on line 2 character 3.

We can make the next selection our primary selection by using <kbd>)</kbd>, which is seen by the `2:12` in the counter, meaning that our primary selection is at the `get_area` method:

<T.NextSelectionPrimary />

And then we can go back to the previous one with <kbd>(</kbd>:

<T.BackToPreviousSelection />

By pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>, we can remove the primary selection, so that `def` is not selected:

<T.RemovedPrimarySelection />

Removing that selection automatically made `get_area` the next selected region. We don't want this one either, so we'll remove it again with <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>:

<T.RemovedPrimarySelectionAgain />

Press <kbd>)</kbd> a few times until you reach the next selection you want to remove. If you go over by one, just press <kbd>(</kbd> to make the previous selection primary.

Let's repeat this step until we _only_ have the words `length`, `width` and `height` selected:

<T.OnlyParamsSelected />

At this point, we can begin our removal process. Go to the beginning of each word by pressing <kbd>b</kbd>, and then press <kbd>l</kbd> a couple of times until you are on the 4th character of each word:

<T.OnFourthCharOfEachWord />

Now, we're going to press <kbd>e</kbd> to go to the end of each word which will highlight it:

<T.SelectEndOfEachParam />

And finally press <kbd>d</kbd> to delete it.

<T.DeletedEndOfEachWord />

Great we're almost there! Let's actually undo this step so that we can look at an alternative way of accomplishing this thing. Press `u` just once which will undo our replacement:

<T.UndidStep />

An alternative way to accomplish the same is to simply select the entire file again with <kbd>%</kbd>:

<T.SelectedEntireFileAgain />

Now, with the power of <kbd>s</kbd> and Regex, we can select the `length`, `width` and `height` words by chaining them together with the "OR" operator. So for instance, type the following: `length|width|height`:

<T.SelectedAllLengthWidthHeight />

This is certaintly simpler but it's good to know both approaches. Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select and yet again, go to the beginning of each word with <kbd>b</kbd> and then move 3 characters to the right with <kbd>lll</kbd>, press <kbd>e</kbd> to go to the end of each word and delete it:

<T.RemovedLastPartOfEachParam />

Now we're going to remove the variable declarations of `result` on each line, and instead directly return the calculation.

Go ahead and select the entire file again with <kbd>%</kbd>. And then use the <kbd>s</kbd> to bring up the select prompt again. Type `result =` which will select all instances of `result =`:

<T.SelectedAllResultVars />

<kbd>Enter</kbd> to select, and then Press <kbd>C</kbd> to duplicate the selection on each line:

<T.SelectedAllResultVarsAndC />

By using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>(</kbd>, we can rotate the _contents_ of the selection backward:

<T.RotatedContentsOfSelections />

Try using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>)</kbd> to rotate the selection forward. You can keep on pressing the key but the difference between <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>)</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>(</kbd> won't be obvious in this example, since we basically have the same selections repeated.

Regardless, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>)</kbd> at least once to get into the following state:

<T.RotatedContentsOfSelections />

Collapse each cursor so that there is only a single selection with <kbd>;</kbd>:

<T.EachSelectionCollapsed />

Now, just press <kbd>d</kbd> twice to delete two characters on each of the 6 lines:

<T.DeletedTwoChars />

Okay so at this point, we are _almost_ there. We just need to delete the `result sult` line.

To do this, use the <kbd>s</kbd> again and type `s` in the prompt. This will select the `s` in each of your selections and place a cursor there:

<T.SelectedAllS />

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select, and then press <kbd>x</kbd> to select the entire line and <kbd>d</kbd> to delete it. Voila!

<T.Deleted3Lines />

We've got just a few steps left. Namely, select the entire file again with <kbd>%</kbd>:

<T.SelectedEntireFileAgain2 />

Press <kbd>\></kbd> which will indent everything by 1 level. We need this since we're going to nest it in a class, after all. You can also use <kbd>\<</kbd> to de-dent the selection by 1 level too.

<T.IndentAllBy1Level />

Now, press <kbd>i</kbd> to go into insert mode at the very beginning of the selection, <kbd>Enter</kbd> to add a newline, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to enter normal mode, <kbd>k</kbd> to go to the line above, <kbd>I</kbd> to enter Insert mode and then type `class Calculator:` and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go back to normal mode.

<T.FinalStatePython />

At last, we've succeeded 🥳!
