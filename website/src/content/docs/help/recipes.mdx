Includes common solutions to some problems.

## Git Integration

Helix comes with basic git integration such as the ability to see which files have been modified on the gutters, and acting on git hunks as text objects. But a more comprehensive git integration can be desired, which is understandable.

Lazygit is the most popular git TUI and you can smoothly integrate it with Helix with the following keymap:

```toml
# helix/config.toml
[keys.normal]
C-g = [
    ":write-all",
    ":new",
    ":insert-output lazygit",
    ":buffer-close!",
    ":redraw",
    ":reload-all"
]
```

Explanation

1. `write-all`: save all buffers so that the changes can be shown in lazygit and commited right away
2. `new`: create new empty buffer
3. `insert-output lazygit`: runs the `lazygit` command and inserts it's output into the new buffer
4. When you exit `lazygit`, `buffer-close!` will kill the previously empty buffer, sending you back to where you were previously.
5. `redraw` is necessary to re-render the UI to show the buffers
6. `reload-all` because if e.g. you commit everything, helix will still show the symbols indicating that lines were changed / deleted on the left of the line numbers. This will prevent that

## Remap Caps Lock to Escape

The <kbd>Esc</kbd> key is quite far away from the home row on most keyboards. Due to this fact, many people remap <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> to <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

To do this, follow instructions for your operating system.

You can use [`xmodmap`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oracular/en/man1/xmodmap.1.html):

```sh
xmodmap -e "keycode 9 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Caps_Lock"
```

:::tip[Make it run automatically (optional)]

To get this change for every session, after you have run the previous commands:

1. Create a file called `~/.xmodmap` with the new keymaps:

   ```sh
   xmodmap -pke > ~/.xmodmap
   ```

1. Create a file called `.xinitrc` in your home directory, containing the following line:

   ```sh
   xmodmap .xmodmap
   ```

AutoHotkey is a free and open source scripting language for Windows, primarily useful for remapping keyboard keys in our example.

<Steps>

1. Install AutoHotkey from the [AutoHotkey installation page](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/).

1. Create a new `remap-caps-lock.ahk` file on your desktop.

1. Right-click on the new script file and select `Edit script`.

1. Add this line to the script:

   ```ahk
   CapsLock::Esc
   ```

1. Run the script by double-clicking on it. It will start running in the background.

</Steps>

:::tip[Make it run automatically (optional)]

<Steps>

1. Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to open the `Run` dialog.

1. Type `shell:startup` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. Copy the `remap-caps-lock.ahk` file and paste it into the Startup folder.

</Steps>

The script will run automatically every time you start your computer.

## Save file without formatting

If you have `auto-format` turned on, but you want to save a file _without formatting_, then do the following:

- `:set-language text`
- Write the file
- Optionally, change it back with `:set-language`

## More intuitive x and X motions

Some people prefer to remap <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>X</kbd> motions from the defaults:

```toml
# helix/config.toml
x = "extend_line_below"
X = "extend_to_line_bounds"
```

To the following:

```toml
# helix/config.toml
x = "select_line_below"
X = "select_line_above"
```

Due to the fact that they may find it more natural to have <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>X</kbd> perform opposite motions, similar to other motions in Helix.

Currently some people want this to become the default.
