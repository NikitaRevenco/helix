Helix is a modal editor, which means that there are different modes for different tasks. The characters you type such as `w` and `g` will perform special commands that speed up editing.

## Why use Modal Editors?

The benefits of using modal editors include:

- Ergonomics: Keeping your hands in the same position and not having to use the mouse for hours at a time.
- Editing speed: Programmers and writers have to edit a **lot** of text. For the time it takes a VSCode user to reach for their mouse, highlight a range of text and delete it, the Helix user would have finished the task 3 times faster.

However, there are some drawbacks aswell:

- It may take some time getting used to. Helix aims to bridge this gap by being a modal editor which is more accessible and usable, without compromising on any of the additional benefits.

In the past, there would also be a major disadvantage that modal editors like Vim do not have wanted Integrated Development Environment (IDE) features, such as:

- Intellisense (_also known as Auto Complete_)
- Debuggers
- Syntax highlighting

However, with the emergence of the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol), [Tree Sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) and [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) these compromises no longer have to be made, as there are now standards which editors can incorporate.
