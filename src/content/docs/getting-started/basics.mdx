title: The Basics
---

Create a new text file and open it with Helix by running `hx file.txt`. This is what you'll see:

[TODO: add screenshot]

Notice the `NOR` in the bottom-right corner, this indicates that you are currently in Normal mode. In this mode, typing letters like `e` and `n` won't insert them into the text, but rather have specific _commands_ which we will explore later.

To actually insert some text, press `i`. `i` is the command to get into Insert mode, indicated by the `INS` in the bottom-right corner. In this mode, the letters you type will be inserted directly into the document. Try it out by writing `Hello helix!`.

To get back into Normal mode press `<esc>` (Escape). This will change the color of your cursor and you will see `NOR` again.

To move your cursor you could use arrow keys both in normal and insert modes. However, this isn't encouraged because your hand will be doing a lot of back-and-forth movement between the arrow keys and the keyboard.

Instead, it is recommended to hold your hands in the following position:

[TODO: add screenshot]

This way, your fingers will always rest on the "home row", which is comprised of the row of keys `a s d f g h j k l`. Instead of stretching to reach the arrow keys, use `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` to move your cursor.

- `h`: moves cursor 1 character to the left.
- `j`: moves cursor 1 line above.
- `k`: moves cursor 1 line below.
- `l`: moves cursor 1 character to the right.

Try holding down `h` and `l` to move horizontally across the text you just wrote!

[TODO: add gif of moving h and l]

We only have one line of text, so let's duplicate it several times. Type:

- `x`, which will select the entire line.
- `y`, which will _**y**ank_ (copy) the selection to _a clipboard_.
- `p`, which will paste the contents of the selection after the cursor.

Spam `p` a few times to create several lines.

Now you can try using the `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` motions traverse the text!

## More Advanced

Let's say we want to replace one of the `helix` words with `world`. To do this, place your cursor on one of the `h` letters:

[TODO: add screenshot]

`e` is a motion which moves to the _**e**nd_ of the current word. Type `e` and it will move your cursor to the end of the `helix`.

It doesn't just move your cursor there, though. The entire `helix` word becomes highlighted:

If we now press `b`, which moves to the _**b**eginning_ of the current word, it'll move us back to where we just were.

Try this out a few times, press `e` and then `b` to select various sections of the text. If you want to remove your selection press `;`.

Let's highlight our `helix` word again:

## Selection-first Approach

Helix's philosophy is that each **action** will act on a selection.

Every time text is modified (an **action**), you will fully anticipate the result -- because you can clearly see the area of text which is highlighted, and thus will be modified.

For example, we currently have the word `helix` selected. To change it to `hello`, press `c`. `c` is a command which acts on a selection.

`c` removes the contents of the current selection and places us in Insert mode, where you can then write your new word. Exit back to Normal mode by pressing `<esc>`.

The `d` command deletes the current selection and copies what has been deleted into a clipboard.

Let's test it out by doing the following:

- Select the line we just changed with `x`.
- `d` to delete this line.
- Spam `p` a few times to create some duplicates.

[TODO: add screenshot]

Now let's remove all of our previous `Hello helix!` by doing the following for each `Hello helix!` line:

- Select the line with `x`.
- `d` to delete it.

Now we have something like this:

[TODO: add screenshot]

What if we made a mistake, and want to go back? The `u` command will _**u**ndo_ our most recent action. It's similar to `Ctrl-z` in other editors.

Try pressing down `u` a few times to get to our previous state, before we made all those modifications:

[TODO: add screenshot]

`U` is similar to `Ctrl-Shift-z` in other editors. It will _undo the last undo_. It's the inverse of `u`.

Press `U` until we get back to our most recent state:

Feel free to make modifications to your file using the commands we have learned so far:

- `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` moves 1 character left, down, up and right.
- `i` enters Insert mode.
- `<esc>` enters Normal mode.
- `x` selects the entire line.
- `y` yanks the selection.
- `p` pastes the recently copied selection.
- `e` moves to the end of the current word.
- `b` moves to the beginning of the current word.
- `;` removes the extra selection.
- `d` deletes the current selection, without exiting Normal mode.
- `c` changes the current selection, by deleting it and entering Insert mode.
- `u` will undo the most recent change.
- `U` will undo the most recent undo.

Once you are happy with your modifications, enter Normal mode and type `:`.

`:` enters _command mode_, which has commands you type out.

- `:w` will _**w**rite_ the current file.
- `:q` will _**q**uit_ the current file.
- `:wq` will both write and quit.
