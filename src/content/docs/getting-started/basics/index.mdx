import OpeningFile from "1.astro";
import InsertMode from "2.astro";
import TerminalPlayer from "../../../../components/Asciinema.astro";

Create a new text file and open it with Helix by running `hx file.txt`. This is what you'll see:

<OpeningFile />

Notice the `NOR` in the bottom-right corner, this indicates that you are currently in Normal mode. In this mode, typing letters like `e` and `n` won't insert them into the text, but rather have specific _commands_ which we will explore later.

To actually insert some text, press `i`, which is the command to get into Insert mode, indicated by the `INS` in the bottom-right corner. In this mode, the letters you type will be inserted directly into the document. Try it out by writing `Hello helix!`.

<InsertMode />

To get back into Normal mode press Esc. This will change the color of your cursor and you will see `NOR` again.

### Movement

To move your cursor you could use arrow keys both in normal and insert modes. However, this isn't encouraged because your hand will be doing a lot of back-and-forth movement between the arrow keys and the keyboard.

Instead, it is recommended to rest your fingers on the "home row", which is comprised of the row of keys `a s d f g h j k l`. Instead of stretching to reach the arrow keys, use `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` to move your cursor..

- `h`: moves cursor 1 character to the left.
- `j`: moves cursor 1 line above.
- `k`: moves cursor 1 line below.
- `l`: moves cursor 1 character to the right.

Try holding down `h` and `l` to move horizontally across the text you just wrote!

<TerminalPlayer src="/h-and-l.cast" />

[TODO: add gif of moving h and l]

### Paste

We only have one line of text, so let's duplicate it several times. Type:

- `x`, which will select the entire line.
- `y`, which will _**y**ank_ (copy) the selection to _a clipboard_.
- `p`, which will paste the contents of the selection after the cursor.

Spam `p` a few times to create several lines.

[TODO: add screenshot]

Now you can try using the `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` motions traverse the text!

### Word-based Movement

Let's say we want to replace one of the `helix` words with `world`. To do this, place your cursor on one of the `h` letters:

[TODO: add screenshot]

`e` is a motion which moves to the _**e**nd_ of the current word. Type `e` and it will move your cursor to the end of the `helix`.

It doesn't just move your cursor there, though. The entire `helix` word becomes highlighted:

[TODO: add screenshot]

If we now press `b`, which moves to the _**b**eginning_ of the current word, it'll move us back to where we just were.

Try this out a few times, press `e` and then `b` to select various sections of the text. If you want to remove your selection press `;`.

Let's highlight our `helix` word again:

[TODO: add screenshot]

### Selection-first Approach

Helix's philosophy is that each **action** will act on a selection.

Every time text is modified (an **action**), you will fully anticipate the result -- because you can clearly see the area of text which is highlighted, and thus will be modified.

For example, we currently have the word `helix` selected. To change it to `hello`, press `c`. `c` is a command which acts on a selection.

`c` removes the contents of the current selection and places us in Insert mode, where you can then write your new word. Exit back to Normal mode by pressing `<esc>`.

### Delete

The `d` command deletes the current selection and copies what has been deleted into a clipboard.

Let's test it out by doing the following:

- Select the line we just changed with `x`.
- `d` to delete this line.
- Spam `p` a few times to create some duplicates.

[TODO: add screenshot]

Now let's remove all of our previous `Hello helix!` by doing the following for each `Hello helix!` line:

- Select the line with `x`.
- `d` to delete it.

Now we have something like this:

[TODO: add screenshot]

### Undo and Redo

What if we made a mistake, and want to go back? The `u` command will _**u**ndo_ our most recent action. It's similar to `Ctrl-z` in other editors.

Try pressing down `u` a few times to get to our previous state, before we made all those modifications:

[TODO: add screenshot]

`U` is similar to `Ctrl-Shift-z` in other editors. It will _undo the last undo_. It's the inverse of `u`.

Press `U` until we get back to our most recent state:

[TODO: add screenshot]

### Checkpoint

Feel free to make modifications to your file using the commands we have learned so far:

- `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` moves 1 character left, down, up and right.
- `i` enters Insert mode.
- `<esc>` enters Normal mode.
- `x` selects the entire line.
- `y` yanks the selection.
- `p` pastes the recently copied selection.
- `e` moves to the end of the current word.
- `b` moves to the beginning of the current word.
- `;` removes the extra selection.
- `d` deletes the current selection, without exiting Normal mode.
- `c` changes the current selection, by deleting it and entering Insert mode.
- `u` will undo the most recent change.
- `U` will undo the most recent undo.

Once you are happy with your modifications, enter Normal mode and type `:`.

`:` enters _command mode_, which has commands you type out.

- `:w` will _**w**rite_ the current file.
- `:q` will _**q**uit_ the current file.
- `:q!` will quit without saving.
- `:wq` will both write and quit.

## More Commands

Let's try out more Helix commands! Open the file again with `hx file.txt`. Select the entire file by pressing `%` and then delete the selection with `d`.

### Registers

Helix has a concept called _registers_, which is like having many clipboards at once (hence the _"a clipboard"_). To interact with them, prefix yank and delete commands with a `"` and then the name of the register.

For example, the contents of the system clipboard are stored inside the `+` register.

:::note

You may need a clipboard provider like [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) to use the system clipboard.

:::

Paste the following content into the file with `"+p`:

```
The plates will still shift
and the clouds will still spew.
The sun will slowly rise
and the moon will follow too.
```

1. Navigate to the last line by using `ge` for _**g**oto end_.
1. Select the last line with `x` and then yank it with `y`.
1. Navigate to the second line by using `2gg`.
1. Select the second line by using `x` and then yank into into the `e` register with `"ey`. `"` selects the register, `e` is the register's name and `y` is the yank command.

Now:

1. Navigate to the third line by using `3gg`.
1. Paste what we copied previously by using `p`.

Notice how we haven't pasted the 2nd line's contents, but rather the last lines'? Because we yanked the 2nd line's contents into the `e` register. To paste from it, use `"ep`.

- `"` signals to the editor that we are going to use a register.
- `e` uses the `e` register.
- `p` pastes contents of the `e` register.

[TODO: add image]

Take note of the fact that when we press `p`, it pastes the contents of the register _after_ the line. To paste _before_, use `P`.

That's great! We learned how to use registers and the system clipboard.

### Goto Word

Using `b` to go to the beginning of the word and `e` to go to the end is useful if you are already at the word you want. But if you are far away, a very powerful command is _**g**oto **w**ord_ -- `gw`.

`gw` will create two letters at the start of every word in sight. When you type those two letters, you instantly jump to the specified word.

[TODO: add video]

### More ways to enter Insert Mode

Select the `clouds` word using `gw`. If you press `i`, you will go into insert mode at the beginning of the selection. There are also 3 more ways to enter Insert mode:

- `a` for _**append**_ go into insert mode at the end of the selection
- `I` go into insert mode at the beginning of the current line
- `A` go into insert mode at the end of the current line
- `o` add a newline below and go into insert mode
- `O` add a newline above and go into insert mode

Try all of them out!

### Replace

You can also replace a selection with contents of a register.

1. Select the `moon` word by using `gw` and yank it with `y`.
2. Select the `sun` word and replace it with `moon` with `R`.

### Search

Go to the first line by using `gg`.

:::tip

You can also use just `gg` to go to the first line, which has the same effect as `1gg`.

:::

To search for a word, use `/` command. Type `will` which is going to highlight the next `will` keyword, and then `Enter` to select it.

Since there are several `will`s in the text, you can cycle between them:

- `n` cycles to the next search.
- `N` cycles to the previous search.

### Move to characters

You can also search for individual characters by using `t`, which stands for _**to**_.

1. Copy the text below

   ```
   Twilight fades; stars—whispering, bold—
   "Hope," they hum; yet shadows unfold...
   Life? A riddle—endless! Who'll dare,
   to seek; to dream: to wander—where?
   ```

1. Select the entire file with `%`
1. Override the selection by using `Space` + `R`.

:::tip

Instead of writing `"+` to interact with the system clipboard everytime, you can also prefix paste and delete motion with `Space`. For example, `Space` + `p` has the same effect as `"+p`.

:::

Go to the first line with `gg` and use `t;` to go to the next semicolon. Repeat this several several times.

To move in the opposite direction, use `T;` to the previous semicolon.

Using `t` and `T` motions will move your cursor _to just before_ the next or the previous occurence of the character.

For example, `te` to go to the next e. `T"` to go to just before the previous double-quote.

The `f` for _**f**ind_ is similar to `t`, but instead it places your cursor _at_ the occurence of the character. Try using `f;` several times. `F` goes the opposite way.

:::tip

By using `Alt` + `.`, you can repeat the last `t`, `T`, `f` or `F` motion.

:::

### Counts

Each motion also accepts an optional _count_, which defaults to 1 if you don't provide it.

- For example, use `2f;` which would be the same as `f;f;`.
- Or `7b` which would be the same as `bbbbbbb`.

### Page Navigation

Currently the text is fairly short, but we can fix that. Select everything with `%`, yank `y` and then paste it 100 times with `100p`. This will create a very big file.

We can use these commands to scroll large chunks of text at once:

- `Ctrl-d` to scroll down half a page
- `Ctrl-u` to scroll up half a page

[TODO: add gif of scrolling]
