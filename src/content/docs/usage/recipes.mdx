Common solutions to Helix problems.

## Git Integration

Helix comes with basic git integration such as the ability to see which files have been modified on the gutters, and acting on git hunks as text objects. But a more comprehensive git integration can be desired, which is understandable.

Lazygit is the most popular git TUI and you can smoothly integrate it with Helix with the following keymap:

```toml
# helix/config.toml
[keys.normal]
C-g = [
    ":write-all",
    ":new",
    ":insert-output lazygit",
    ":buffer-close!",
    ":redraw",
    ":reload-all"
]
```

Explanation

1. `write-all`: save all buffers so that the changes can be shown in lazygit and commited right away
2. `new`: create new empty buffer
3. `insert-output lazygit`: runs the `lazygit` command and inserts it's output into the new buffer
4. when you exit lazygit, `buffer-close!` will kill the previously empty buffer and send you pack to where you were previously
5. `redraw` is necessary to re-render the UI to show the buffers
6. `reload-all` because if e.g. you commit everything, helix will still show the symbols indicating that lines were changed / deleted on the left of the line numbers. This will prevent that

## Save file without formatting

If you have `auto-format` turned on, but you want to save a file _without formatting_, then do the following:

- `:set-language text`
- Write the file
- Optionally, change it back with `:set-language`
