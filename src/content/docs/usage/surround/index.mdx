title: Surround
---

Helix comes with built-in surround support, allowing you to perform actions such as:

- Surround selection with character
- Delete surrounding character
- Change surrounding character

You can surround selections with specific characters with <kbd>ms</kbd> for _**m**ake **s**urrounding_. For example, with the following state:

[TODO: add image]

Pressing <kbd>ms(</kbd>, you surround the selection with `(`:

[TODO: add image]

But what if we actually meant to surround it with `{` instead? That's fine! We can _**m**ake **r**eplace_ the surrounding character with <kbd>mr</kbd>

For instance, <kbd>mr(\{</kbd> replaces the surrounding `(` with a `{`:

[TODO: add image]

If we wanted to delete the surrounding character, we could also use <kbd>md</kbd> for _**m**ake **d**elete_. For example to delete the nearest surrounding pair of `{`, use <kbd>md\{</kbd>.

[TODO: add image]

Helix has support for the following pairs of surrounds:

- `{` and `}`
- `(` and `)`
- `[` and `]`
- `<` and `>`

You can also use any other character which will act on the literal characters. For instance, if we have a markdown file like follows:

[TODO: add image of BELOW]
[NOTE: replace asterisks with __ __]

```md
Hello **world**!
```

Then pressing <kbd>md*</kbd> will delete the nearest `*`.

[TODO: add image of BELOW]

```md
Hello _world_!
```

Or using <kbd>mro\{</kbd> will replace the nearest pairs of `o` character with `{`:

[TODO: add image of BELOW]

```md
Hell{ _w}rld_!
```
