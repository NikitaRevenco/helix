title: Language Support
---

Language Servers support is a priority for Helix, and we provide out of the box configurations for basically every language you would want.

In this guide we'll explore how to setup language server for Python, as well as formatting on save. The process will be similar for other languages.

## Language Servers

First, let's check what we need to add Python support. Run:

```sh
hx --health python
```

```ansi
Configured language servers:
 [31mâœ˜[0m ruff: [31m'ruff' not found in $PATH[0m
 [31mâœ˜[0m jedi-language-server: [31m'jedi-language-server' not found in $PATH[0m
 [31mâœ˜[0m pylsp:[31m 'pylsp' not found in $PATH[0m
Configured debug adapter: [33mNone[0m
Configured formatter: [33mNone[0m
Highlight queries: [32mâœ“[0m
Textobject queries: [32mâœ“[0m
Indent queries: [32mâœ“[0m
```

There are 3 available language servers that Helix configures for us, we can use any of them. We're going to go with _ruff_.

The message `'ruff' not found in $PATH` indicates that we haven't installed the software on our computer. To fix it, we are going to install

For Helix to use a language server, it must first be installed onto your
computer. If it is one of the default language servers, it will be used
automatically with no further setup needed once it is installed.

You can see the configuration of the default language servers for each language
in the
[helix repo `languages.toml` file](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/languages.toml).
By adding the configurations below, you can supplement or replace the default
configurations.

Check if your operating system repository has them available, or install them
manually, following the instructions below.

If your language server does not support stdio, you can use `netcat` as a
drop-in proxy, just add this to your `languages.toml`:

```toml
[language-server.example-language-server]
command = "nc"
args = ["127.0.0.1", "6008"]

[[language]]
name = "example-language"
language-servers = [ "example-language-server" ]
```
