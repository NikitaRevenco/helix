## Surrounds

In Helix you can:

- Surround selection with character
- Delete surrounding character
- Change surrounding character

Learn more at [surrounds](/usage/text-manipulation#surrounds).

## Text Objects

Text Objects are a way to manipulate a piece of text in a structured way. They allow you to refer to blocks of text based on their purpose.

For example, there are keybindings for these actions:

- Select inside of function definition.
- Select the next changed text tracked by git.
- Select the previous type.
- ...and many others

Learn more at [text objects](/usage/text-manipulation#text-objects).

## Select Mode

From what we've currently seen, each motion in Helix will replace the entire selection.

But if you don't want to replace the selection, and instead want to shrink or extend it, then you may use [/usage/select-mode].

## Multiple Cursors

Helix treats multiple cursor as a first-class citizen. For instance, let's say we had the following object in JavaScript:

[TODO: add image -- AS BELOW]

```js
const palette = {
  apricot: "#f47868",
  lightning: "#ffcd1c",
  delta: "#6F44F0",
};
```

Now, we want to transform this object into an array of tuples where, the first element of each tuple is the key of the object and the second element is the value:

[TODO: add image -- AS BELOW]

```js
const palette = [
  ["apricot", "#f47868"],
  ["lightning", "#ffcd1c"],
  ["delta", "#6F44F0"],
];
```

We could make extensive usage of Helix's multiple cursor functionality by following these steps:

1. <kbd>mr\{[</kbd> to replace the surrounding `{` with `[`:

[TODO: add image]

2. <kbd>mi[</kbd> to select inside the entire array:

[TODO: add image]

3. <kbd>s</kbd> to enter select mode.

[TODO: add image]

4. <kbd>:</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> will place a cursor on every `:`.

[TODO: add image]

5. <kbd>r,</kbd> replaces each selection with a `,`. A cursor is line a single-width selection, and we have multiple cursors, so it will replace each `:` with `,`.

[TODO: add image]

6. <kbd>t,</kbd> moves the cursor on each line to the ending comma.

[TODO: add image]

7. <kbd>;</kbd> the selection around each cursor into a single selection.

[TODO: add image]

8. <kbd>vgs</kbd> selects each line excluding the final comma.

[TODO: add image]

9. <kbd>ms[</kbd> surrounds each individual selection with `[` to turn it into an array.

[TODO: add image]

10. <kbd>l</kbd> moves 1 character forward.

[TODO: add image]

11. <kbd>e</kbd> selects until the end of each word.

[TODO: add image]

12. <kbd>ms"</kbd> surrounds the items with double quotes to make strings.

[TODO: add image]

The final command to achieve all of that is `mr{[mi[s:<enter>r,t,;vgsms[lems"`.

As we just saw, the multiple cursor feature is extremely powerful in Helix as it allows for complex transformations of text. It's also the main way to do searh-and-replace.

## Recipes

Includes common solutions to some problems, such as:

- Git integration
- Remapping all the `Alt` keys
- Popular key bindings

Learn more at [recipes](/usage/recipes).

## Languages

Helix has built-in zero-config support for syntax highlighting and language servers which provides functionality such as:

- Goto definition
- Hover
- Goto references
- Search symbol in workspace
- Diagnostics

Learn how to [activate language servers](/usage/languages#language-servers) and setup [formatting on save](/usage/languages#formatters).

Currently, we are also experimenting with [debuggers](/usage/languages#debuggers).

## Configuration

Helix makes it a priority to have a solid out-of-the-box experience, with minimal configuration required to start using the editor.

However, there are many things one may wish to customize such as:

- Creating custom keybindings and macros
- Using custom theme
- Configure stuff like auto pairs, statusline, etc.

To learn more, check out [configuration](/usage/configuration).
