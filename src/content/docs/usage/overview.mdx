## Multiple Cursors and Macros

One of the most powerful features Helix has is multiple cursor support in combination with macros.

It allows you to perform complex refactors which can be broken down to a series of steps, as well as seacrh-and-replace.

To learn more, check out [multiple cursors](/usage/multiple-cursors).

## Text Manipulation

### Surrounds

In Helix you can:

- Surround selection with character
- Delete surrounding character
- Change surrounding character

For instance:

- Select inside of a function.
- Move to the next argument and seletc it.
- Select the next changed text tracked by git.
- Select the previous type.

## Configuration

Helix makes it a priority to have a solid out-of-the-box experience, with minimal configuration required to start using the editor.

However, there are many things one may wish to customize such as:

- Creating custom keybindings and macros
- Using custom theme
- Configure stuff like auto pairs, statusline, etc.
