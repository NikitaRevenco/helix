## Surrounds

You can surround selections with specific characters with <kbd>ms</kbd> for _**m**ake **s**urrounding_. For example, with the following state:

[TODO: add image]

Pressing <kbd>ms(</kbd>, you surround the selection with `(`:

[TODO: add image]

But what if we actually meant to surround it with `{` instead? That's fine! We can _**m**ake **r**eplace_ the surrounding character with <kbd>mr</kbd>

For instance, <kbd>mr({</kbd> replaces the surrounding `(` with a `{`:

[TODO: add image]

If we wanted to delete the surrounding character, we could also use <kbd>md</kbd> for _**make **d\*\*elete_. For example to delete the nearest surrounding pair of `{`, use <kbd>md{</kbd>.

[TODO: add image]

Helix has support for the following pairs of surrounds:

- `{` and `}`
- `(` and `)`
- `[` and `]`
- `<` and `>`

You can also use any other character which will act on the literal characters. For instance, if we have a markdown file like follows:

[TODO: add image of BELOW]

```md
Hello **world**!
```

Then pressing `md*` will delete the nearest `*`.

[TODO: add image of BELOW]

```md
Hello _world_!
```

Or using `mro{` will replace the nearest pairs of `o` character with `{`:

[TODO: add image of BELOW]

```md
Hell{ _w}rld_!
```

In the future, _may_ also add support for [acting on a surrounding pair of tags](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12055).
