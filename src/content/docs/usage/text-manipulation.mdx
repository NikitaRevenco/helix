## Surrounds

You can surround selections with specific characters with <kbd>ms</kbd> for _**m**ake **s**urrounding_. For example, with the following state:

[TODO: add image]

Pressing <kbd>ms(</kbd>, you surround the selection with `(`:

[TODO: add image]

But what if we actually meant to surround it with `{` instead? That's fine! We can _**m**ake **r**eplace_ the surrounding character with <kbd>mr</kbd>

For instance, <kbd>mr(\{</kbd> replaces the surrounding `(` with a `{`:

[TODO: add image]

If we wanted to delete the surrounding character, we could also use <kbd>md</kbd> for _**make **d\*\*elete_. For example to delete the nearest surrounding pair of `{`, use <kbd>md\{</kbd>.

[TODO: add image]

Helix has support for the following pairs of surrounds:

- `{` and `}`
- `(` and `)`
- `[` and `]`
- `<` and `>`

You can also use any other character which will act on the literal characters. For instance, if we have a markdown file like follows:

[TODO: add image of BELOW]
[NOTE: replace asterisks with __ __]

```md
Hello **world**!
```

Then pressing <kbd>md*</kbd> will delete the nearest `*`.

[TODO: add image of BELOW]

```md
Hello _world_!
```

Or using <kbd>mro\{</kbd> will replace the nearest pairs of `o` character with `\{`:

[TODO: add image of BELOW]

```md
Hell{ _w}rld_!
```

## Text Objects

### Example

Text Objects are a way to manipulate a piece of text in a structured way. They allow you to refer to blocks of text based on their purpose.

For example, with the following Python file:

[TODO: add image, with below contents]

```python
class Thing:
  def __init__(self):
    self.thing = "Hello world"

  def say_thing(self):
    print(self.thing)
```

Press <kbd>maf</kbd> for _**m**anipulate **a**round **f**unction_ to select the entire method:

[TODO: add image]

Or <kbd>mif</kbd> for _**m**anipulate **i**nside **f**unction_ to select the body of the method:

[TODO: add image]

Additionally, you can move between most text objects. For instance, <kbd>]f</kbd> with go to the previous function.

[TODO: add image]

The full syntax is:

- <kbd>mi</kbd> + `<textobject>` to _**m**anipulate **i**nside_ a textobject. Highlight a smaller region of the text object, for example the body of a function.
- <kbd>ma</kbd> + `<textobject>` to _**m**anipulate **a**round_ a textobject. Selects the entire text object, including surrounding whitespace.
- <kbd>]</kbd> + `<textobject>` to go to the next instance of the textobject.
- <kbd>[</kbd> + `<textobject>` to go to the previous instance of the textobject.

### List of Text Objects

- `p`, `w` and `W`: [primitive text objects](#primitive)
- `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `<`, `>`, `'`, `"` and `` ` ``: [pair text objects](#pair)
- `g`: [git hunk](#git)
- `f`, `t`, `a`, `c`, `T`, `g`: [tree-sitter text objects](#tree-sitter)

#### Primitive

##### word

A word is consists only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, so `a-Z`, `0-9` and `_`.

For instance, take the following file, with two cursors:

[TODO: add below. each cursor is at *]

```rs
pri*ntln!("Hello, wo*rld");
```

- Selecting inside word with <kbd>miw</kbd>:

[TODO: add img]

- Selecting around word with <kbd>maw</kbd>:

[TODO: add img]

##### WORD

A WORD is always delimited by whitespace such as newlines, tabs and spaces.

Consider this file again:

[TODO: add below. each cursor is at *]

```rs
pri*ntln!("Hello, wo*rld");
```

- Selecting inside WORD with <kbd>miW</kbd>:

[TODO: add img]

- Selecting around WORD with <kbd>maW</kbd>:

[TODO: add img]

##### Paragraph

A paragraph is delimited by two newlines, as well as start and end of files. For example in the following file with 3 cursors:

[TODO: add below, with cursors at *]

````md
```md
One two thr\*ee four.

Five six sev\*en eight.

Nine ten \*eleven.
```
````

- Select inside paragarph with <kbd>mip</kbd>:

[TODO: add image]

- Select around paragraph with <kbd>map</kbd>:

[TODO: add image]

#### Surround Pairs

These allow you to select:

- Inside of the surrounding pair, excluding the surrounding characters
- Inside of the surrounding pair, including the surrounding characters

For example, with the following state:

[TODO: add from below]

```ts
const say = (s: string) => console.log(s);
```

Pressing <kbd>mi(</kbd> will select:

[TODO: add image]

While <kbd>mi)</kbd> will select:

[TODO: add image]

List of available pairs:

- `(` and `)`
- `[` and `]`
- `{` and `}`
- `<` and `>`
- `'` and `'`
- `"` and `"`
- `` ` `` and `` ` ``

#### Git Hunk

If you are in a repository, then you will also have the `g` for _**g**it hunk_ textobject.

It will select the entire change.

For instance, if we have the following file, with the added lines visible by the green bar indicator on the gutter:

[TODO: add img]

Then <kbd>mig</kbd> will select the git hunk.

[TODO: add img]

#### Tree-sitter Text Objects

Available for most languages.

To find out for your language, run `hx --health <language>`. For example if haskell queries are available, running `hx --health haskell` will show:

```ansi
Textobject queries: [32mâœ“
```

Available text objects:

- `f` for _**f**unction_
- `t` for _**t**ype_
- `a` for _**a**rgument_
- `c` for _**c**omment_
- `T` for _**T**est_
