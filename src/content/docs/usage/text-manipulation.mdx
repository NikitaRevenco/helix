## Surrounds

You can surround selections with specific characters with <kbd>ms</kbd> for _**m**ake **s**urrounding_. For example, with the following state:

[TODO: add image]

Pressing <kbd>ms(</kbd>, you surround the selection with `(`:

[TODO: add image]

But what if we actually meant to surround it with `{` instead? That's fine! We can _**m**ake **r**eplace_ the surrounding character with <kbd>mr</kbd>

For instance, <kbd>mr(\{</kbd> replaces the surrounding `(` with a `{`:

[TODO: add image]

If we wanted to delete the surrounding character, we could also use <kbd>md</kbd> for _**make **d\*\*elete_. For example to delete the nearest surrounding pair of `{`, use <kbd>md\{</kbd>.

[TODO: add image]

Helix has support for the following pairs of surrounds:

- `{` and `}`
- `(` and `)`
- `[` and `]`
- `<` and `>`

You can also use any other character which will act on the literal characters. For instance, if we have a markdown file like follows:

[TODO: add image of BELOW]
[NOTE: replace asterisks with __ __]

```md
Hello **world**!
```

Then pressing <kbd>md*</kbd> will delete the nearest `*`.

[TODO: add image of BELOW]

```md
Hello _world_!
```

Or using <kbd>mro\{</kbd> will replace the nearest pairs of `o` character with `\{`:

[TODO: add image of BELOW]

```md
Hell{ _w}rld_!
```

In the future, _may_ also add support for [acting on a surrounding pair of tags](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12055).

## Text Objects

### Example

Text Objects are a way to manipulate a piece of text in a structured way. They allow you to refer to blocks of text based on their purpose.

For example, with the following Python file:

[TODO: add image, with below contents]

```python
class Thing:
  def __init__(self):
    self.thing = "Hello world"

  def say_thing(self):
    print(self.thing)
```

Press <kbd>maf</kbd> for _**m**anipulate **a**round **f**unction_ to select the entire method:

[TODO: add image]

Or <kbd>mif</kbd> for _**m**anipulate **i**nside **f**unction_ to select the body of the method:

[TODO: add image]

Additionally, you can move between text objects. For instance, <kbd>]f</kbd> with go to the previous function.

[TODO: add image]

### Syntax

- <kbd>ma</kbd> + `<textobject>` to _**m**anipulate **a**round_ a textobject. Highlight the entire text object, for example the entire function.
- <kbd>mi</kbd> + `<textobject>` to _**m**anipulate **i**nside_ a textobject. Highlight a smaller region of the text object, for example the body of a function.

### Basic Text Objects

These are available everywhere.

#### word and WORD

word and WORD textobjects allow you to act on various types of consecutive characters. For example:

- A word is consists only of alphanumeric characters and underscores (`a-Z`, `0-9`, `_`).
- A WORD is always delimited by whitespace (e.g. newlines, tabs, spaces).

For instance, take the following file, with two cursors:

[TODO: add below. each cursor is at *]

```rs
pri*ntln!("Hello, wo*rld");
```

Selecting inside word with <kbd>miw</kbd>:

Selecting inside WORD with <kbd>miW</kbd>:

---

The "around" versions are similar, except they also include the surrounding whitespace. For instance:

Selecting around word with <kbd>maw</kbd>:

Selecting around WORD with <kbd>maW</kbd>:

#### W - WORD

#### p - Paragraph

#### Surround Pairs

These allow you to select:

- Inside of the surrounding pair, excluding the surrounding characters
- Inside of the surrounding pair, including the surrounding characters

For example, with the following state:

[TODO: add from below]

```ts
const say = (s: string) => console.log(s);
```

Pressing <kbd>mi(</kbd> will select:

[TODO: add image]

While <kbd>mi)</kbd> will select:

[TODO: add image]

All of the available pairs:

- `(` and `)`
- `[` and `]`
- `{` and `}`
- `<` and `>`
- `'` and `'`
- `"` and `"`
- `` ` `` and `` ` ``
