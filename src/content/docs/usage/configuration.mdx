In the editor, you can change various options without editing any config file. For example by using `:set cursorline false`. This will be reset when you leave the editor.

To permanently store config options, create a `config.toml` file located in your config directory:

- Linux and Mac: `~/.config/helix/config.toml`
- Windows: `%AppData%\helix\config.toml`

:::tip

You also can open the config file by typing `:config-open` within Helix in normal mode.

## Sample Config

```toml
# helix/config.toml
theme = "catppuccin-mocha"

[editor]
line-number = "relative"
mouse = false

[editor.cursor-shape]
insert = "bar"
normal = "block"
select = "underline"
```

## Conclusion

For a full overview of every option, check out the [editor configuration reference](/reference/configuration#editor-section).

Helix comes with _a lot_ of bundled themes, so they are on a separate page. See the [full theme reference](/reference/themes)
