Text Objects are a way to manipulate a piece of text in a structured way. They allow you to refer to blocks of text based on their purpose and perform powerful actions. For instance:

- Select inside of a function.
- Move to the next argument and seletc it.
- Select the next changed text tracked by git.
- Select the previous type.

For example, with the following Python file:

<InitialPythonFile />

Move your cursor in the `__init__` method, and press <kbd>maf</kbd> for _**m**anipulate **a**round **f**unction_ to select the entire method:

<SelectedInitMethod />

Or <kbd>mif</kbd> for _**m**anipulate **i**nside **f**unction_ to select the body of the method:

<SelectedInsideInitMethod />

Additionally, you can move between most text objects. For instance, <kbd>]f</kbd> with go to the previous function.

<MoveToNextMethod />

The full syntax is:

- <kbd>mi</kbd> + `<textobject>` to _**m**anipulate **i**nside_ a textobject. Highlight a smaller region of the text object, for example the body of a function.
- <kbd>ma</kbd> + `<textobject>` to _**m**anipulate **a**round_ a textobject. Selects the entire text object, including surrounding whitespace.
- <kbd>]</kbd> + `<textobject>` to go to the next instance of the textobject.
- <kbd>[</kbd> + `<textobject>` to go to the previous instance of the textobject.

### List of Text Objects

- `p`, `w` and `W`: [primitive text objects](#primitive)
- `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `<`, `>`, `'`, `"` and `` ` ``: [pair text objects](#pair-text-objects)
- `g`: [git hunk](#git-hunk)
- `f`, `t`, `a`, `c`, `T`, `g`: [tree-sitter text objects](#tree-sitter-text-objects)

#### Primitive

##### word

A word is consists only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, so `a-Z`, `0-9` and `_`.

For instance, take the following file, with two cursors:

<RustInitialState />

```rs
pri*ntln!("Hello, wo*rld");
```

- Selecting inside word with <kbd>miw</kbd>:

<SelectedInsideWord />

- Selecting around word with <kbd>maw</kbd>:

<SelectedAroundWord />

Note that we now also have the space before the `world` as our selection!

##### WORD

A WORD is always delimited by whitespace such as newlines, tabs and spaces.

Consider this file again:

<RustInitialState />

- Selecting inside WORD with <kbd>miW</kbd>:

<SelectedInsideWORD />

- Selecting around WORD with <kbd>maW</kbd>:

<SelectedAroundWORD />

Note that the first selection was `println!("Hey, ` and the second selection is ` world!");`, since these selections share a common character (the space), they essentially merge.

##### Paragraph

A paragraph is delimited by two newlines, as well as start and end of files. For example in the following file with 3 cursors:

<MarkdownFile />

- Select inside paragarph with <kbd>mip</kbd>:

<MarkdownFileSelectParagraphs />

- Select around paragraph with <kbd>map</kbd>:

<MarkdownFileSelectAroundParagraphs />

#### Pair Text Objects

These allow you to select:

- Inside of the surrounding pair, excluding the surrounding characters
- Inside of the surrounding pair, including the surrounding characters

For example, with the following state:

<TypescriptFile />

Pressing <kbd>mi(</kbd> will select:

<TypescriptFileInsideParentheses />

While <kbd>mi)</kbd> will select:

<TypescriptFileAroundParentheses />

List of available pairs:

- `(` and `)`
- `[` and `]`
- `{` and `}`
- `<` and `>`
- `'` and `'`
- `"` and `"`
- `` ` `` and `` ` ``

#### Git Hunk

If you are in a repository, then you will also have the `g` for _**g**it hunk_ textobject.

It will select the entire change.

For instance, if we have the following file, with the added lines visible by the green bar indicator on the gutter:

<GitHunkExample />

Then <kbd>mig</kbd> will select the git hunk.

<GitHunkSelected />

#### Tree-sitter Text Objects

Available for most languages.

To find out for your language, run `hx --health <language>`. For example if haskell queries are available, running `hx --health haskell` will show:

```ansi
Textobject queries: [32mâœ“
```

Available text objects:

- `f` for _**f**unction_
- `t` for _**t**ype_
- `a` for _**a**rgument_
- `c` for _**c**omment_
- `T` for _**T**est_

## Syntax-aware Motions

Some commands allow you to move the selection according to its location in the syntax tree. For example, many languages have the following syntax for function calls:

<SyntaxAwareInit />

If you use <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd>, it will select the next sibling:

<NextSibling />

Similarly, <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> selects the previous sibling:

<PrevSibling />

<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> will expand selection to the parent node:

<ParentNode />
