## Framework

This site is built using [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), which is built upon [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework which is considered by many to be the best static site generation framework.

It also uses the following starlight plugins:

| plugin                                                                       | description                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`starlight-links-validator`](https://starlight-links-validator.vercel.app/) | Ensures all internal links are valid before building site  |
| [`starlight-blog`](https://starlight-blog-docs.vercel.app/)                  | Makes it easy to have a news section for new helix updates |

## Termshot

Some pages on this site use **Termshot** which is like screenshot + terminal = Termshot.

Since terminals are rendered in characters, it's very easy to read these characters and convert to HTML which can be displayed.

This is similar to what [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) does, except Termshots are just static pictures and not videos.
